# ScanImageTools
MATLAB tools for external scripting of ScanImage

ScanImage can be scripted with [user functions](http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com/display/SI2016/User+Functions) and/or via the [API](http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com/display/API/Introduction+to+the+ScanImage+API). 
This makes it possible to modify ScanImage without changing the source code. Presently, ScanImageTools contains a single example tool that plots the mean intensity of all open channel windows over time.
